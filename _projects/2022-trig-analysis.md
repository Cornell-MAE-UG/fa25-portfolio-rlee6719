As part of my MAE 4300 coursework, I completed a multi week engineering ethics portfolio centered on the Boeing 737 MAX MCAS system. The project guided me through identifying ethical issues, narrowing them into precise decision questions, and analyzing them using the ASME Code of Ethics. I focused on whether Boeing certification engineers should have refused to approve MCAS given its single sensor dependency and lack of pilot notification, framing the problem around public safety, professional responsibility, and organizational pressure in safety critical engineering systems.

Through structured stakeholder analysis and ethical conflict mapping, I examined how competing priorities such as regulatory delegation, cost and schedule pressure, corporate hierarchy, and information silos contributed to ethical failure despite the presence of technically qualified engineers. I then evaluated these issues using ASME canons related to public safety, professional competence, truthful communication, and employer loyalty, ultimately concluding that public safety must take absolute precedence in life critical systems. The portfolio further explored practical constraints engineers face in real organizations and proposed prevention strategies at the individual, organizational, and systemic levels, including stronger safety review authority, improved transparency, and reduced regulatory capture.

This project strengthened my ability to analyze complex engineering decisions beyond purely technical performance, emphasizing how system design choices, organizational structures, and ethical judgment intersect in real world engineering practice. It reinforced the importance of redundancy, transparency, and professional accountability, principles I aim to carry forward into future engineering work.
